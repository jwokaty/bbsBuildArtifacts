<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>We’d like to be able to get a quick overview of status for a subset of Bioconductor packages. “Status” is relative to Bioconductor version, package version, build platform, and condition of the platform.</p>
<p>We’ll gradually assemble all the relevant information.</p>
<div id="example" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#example" class="anchor"></a>Example</h2>
<p>We have the artifacts for Bioconductor 3.13 for a small number of packages. These are placed in <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/tempfile.html">tempdir()</a></code> via <code><a href="../reference/setup_demo_artifacts.html">setup_demo_artifacts()</a></code>.</p>
<p><code>select_artifacts</code> takes the path to a collection of artifacts, and a vector of regular expressions to isolate a group of packages of interest.</p>

<p>We use the fact that the artifact for package <code>a4</code> will have a period right after the package name to select only it and no other packages with names starting with the string <code>a4</code>.</p>
