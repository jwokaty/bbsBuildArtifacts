Slice and analyze Bioc Build System artifacts

See the "Get started" tab above for general information.

Our aim is to find all relevant information on build,
install, check processes in the Bioconductor Build System.
We have elapsed times and status codes for all software
packages, by host, by version, in the existing code.

As of 24 December 2021, we have a shiny-based browser that
speeds discovery of adverse events in the package build process:

For the linux host nebbiolo2 we show in the vignette
how to create the display and query:
